# RECOMMENDER SYSTEM

## OBJECTIVE
This project utilizes several recommendation techniques to provide effective suggestions. Popularity-based recommendations are implemented using Bayesian averages to rank items. Content-based recommendations leverage cosine similarity to suggest items similar to a user's preferences. Additionally, collaborative filtering is implemented using the Surprise library, incorporating both user-based and item-based approaches to enhance personalization.
